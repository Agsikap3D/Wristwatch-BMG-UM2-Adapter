This is a mod for the ["WWBMG Extruder"](https://github.com/bythorsthunder/Voron_Mods/tree/main/Wristwatch_Extruder_BMG) of ["bythorsthunder"](https://github.com/bythorsthunder).<br>
Allows the use of the cheap UM2 PTFE tube couplers and 3d printed clips for securing the PTFE tube to the extruder.  

## Installation Notes
1.  After assembling the WWBMG using the new housing, press the UM2 coupling into the provided hole to install it.
2.  Print multiple thicknesses of the clip and test which one fits best. Ideally, it should just snugly fit (But easy to remove) and eliminate vertical play on the coupling.
3.  When installing/removing the PTFE tube:

```
INSTALLING:
Detach the clip ---> Push the tube into the coupling ---> Reattach the clip

REMOVING:
Detach the clip ---> Press down the coupling ---> While pressing down, pull the tube
```
