This is a mod for the WWBMG extruder:  
https://github.com/bythorsthunder/Voron_Mods/tree/main/Wristwatch_Extruder_BMG

Allows the use of the cheap UM2 PTFE adapters as an alternative to the ECAS Fitting for securing the PTFE tube.  
The function is similar to the ECAS fitting, but instead of a spring like loaded grip, we will use clips.

## Installation Notes:
1.) Assemble the WWBMG extruder and use the new main body housing.  
2.) Install the UM2 fitting by pressing it to the hole. You can still detach it if necessary, but be careful not breaking it.

3.) Print multiple thicknesses of the UM2 Clip and test which one fits best. Ideally, it should just snugly fit and eliminate vertical play on the fitting. Not loose, but also not to tight. As a baseline, use the 1.8mm variant.

4.) When installing the PTFE tube, the clip must be removed before pushing down the tube. Reinstall the clip to secure the tube.  
5.) When detaching the tube, remove the clip and press the UM2 fitting down before and while pulling the tube.  
6.) I have also tweaked the mounting holes to match an Orbiter 2.0 mounting.
